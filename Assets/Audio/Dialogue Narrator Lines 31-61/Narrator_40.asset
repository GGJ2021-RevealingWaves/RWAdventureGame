  subtitles: "So, I know it's outta the blue for\r\nme to do this kind of stuff.
    But I\r\nwanted to give you something for\r\nthese boots you got me. But I also\r\ngot
    you this as a thank you for\r\nalways being there for me. I know I\r\ncan be
    a stubborn-ass sometimes,\r\nbut you were the one who pushed me\r\nto follow
    my dreams and get that\r\ncabin.\r You always listened to me go on and\r on about
    the fireplace and the\r\nbridge and took the time to get me\r\nsomething that
    helped me out there.\r\nI wanted the plant to show just how\r\nfar I've come
    thanks to you. I and\r\nthe plant have gotten to grow a lot\r\nbecause of you...So,
    thank you.\r\nFor it all.\r\n\n"
