  subtitles: "Narrator:\nI know I\r can be a stubborn-ass sometimes,\r but you were
    the one who pushed me\r to follow my dreams and get that\r cabin.\r You always
    listened to me go on and\r on about the fireplace and the\r bridge and took the
    time to get\r something that helped me get out there.\r"
